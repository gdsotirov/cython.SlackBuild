cython: Cython (C-Extensions for Python)
cython:
cython: Cython is a language that makes writing C extensions for the Python
cython: language as easy as Python itself.  Cython is based on the well-known
cython: Pyrex, but supports more cutting edge functionality and
cython: optimizations.
cython: The Cython language is very close to the Python language, but Cython
cython: additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on
cython: variables and class attributes.  This allows the compiler to generate
cython: very efficient C code from Cython code.
cython: This makes Cython the ideal language for wrapping external C libs,
cython: and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code.
